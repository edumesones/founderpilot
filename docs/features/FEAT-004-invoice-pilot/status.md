## Blockers

### 🔴 Blocker: Plan Phase Not Completed
- **Added:** 2026-02-02
- **Description:** Ralph Loop hit max iterations during Critical Analysis, Plan, and Branch phases. The tasks.md file is still a template with no concrete implementation tasks.
- **Impact:** Cannot proceed with implementation without a concrete task list and design
- **Needs:** Manual execution of Plan phase to generate:
  - Concrete tasks in tasks.md
  - Technical design in design.md
  - Proper branch creation
- **Status:** Blocked - requires human intervention or manual plan execution

<!-- When adding a blocker:
### 🔴 Blocker: [Title]
- **Added:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Description:** What's blocking
- **Impact:** What can't proceed
- **Needs:** What's needed to unblock
- **Status:** Investigating / Waiting / Resolved
